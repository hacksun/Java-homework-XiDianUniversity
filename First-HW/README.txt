This is my first homework. And this homework includes two files, one is 'SumOfArgs.java',
the another is 'CRS'. It's worth to mention that the CRS.java file includes four classes,
one is the main class CRS, and the others are Student, Course, Book.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Directory Structure:

CRS.java: the second question

SumOfArgs.java: the first question

README.txt: to explain this homework

第一次实验报告： there are two types of this file, and one is docx, another is pdf, I save 
this file as pdf because I'm afraid that pictures in the docx will move which wil affect 
the feeling of the experimental report.

To run the two source files, you can choose the cmd or the intelliJ, I have already tested
on both of them.
